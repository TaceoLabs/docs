# TACEO:Proof Overview

### What is TACEO:Proof?

TACEO:Proof is an MPC + coSNARK network that enables developers to offload Groth16 proof generation from browsers and mobile devices. 
Clients submit encrypted input shares and a short-lived voucher; within milliseconds they receive back a standard ZK proof, verifiable by existing verifiers, with no single party in the network seeing the full witness.

### Key Terminology

- **CCL (Cryptographic Coordination Layer):** Orchestrates jobs, manages vouchers and blueprints, dispatches work via AWS SNS/SQS and collects proofs.
- **NPS (Node Provider Service):** Runs on each provider, pulls work from SQS, assigns it to a local CSE, and handles retries and resource tracking.
- **CSE (coSNARK Engine):** Dockerised binary that connects peer-to-peer over QUIC, executes the MPC + SNARK circuit, and produces proof shares.
- **Voucher:** A JWT issued by the CCL that authorises a specific blueprint and usage limits.
- **Blueprint:** A circuit definition plus proving/verification keys and cluster configuration.
- **MPC (Multiparty Computation):** Secret-shares inputs across nodes to compute functions without revealing private data.
- **coSNARK:** A SNARK prover embedded in an MPC protocolâ€”multiple parties jointly generate a succinct proof.

### High-Level Architecture

1. **Client** packages inputs (with or without local witness extension), encrypts shares under CSE public keys, and calls the CCL.
2. **CCL** verifies the voucher, writes a job record, and publishes to three NPS queues.
3. **NPS** picks a CSE, delivers encrypted shares and peer info, then waits for the proof share.
4. **CSEs** form an MPC group over QUIC, run the full SNARK circuit inside MPC, assemble the Groth16 proof, and hand it back to their NPS.
5. **CCL** gathers the final proof, verifies node signatures, stores the result, and returns it to the client.

### Proof Flow Summary

- **Client-side witness extension:** you compute the full witness locally, then secret-share and submit, or,
- **MPC-side witness extension:** secret-share raw witness; the network extends the witness during MPC.
- **One RPC call:** replace `prove()` with a single network invocation.
- **Sub-second turnaround:** typical proofs return in under 250 ms.
- **Groth16 only (beta):** byte-identical proofs for seamless verifier compatibility.
