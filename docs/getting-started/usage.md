# Usage

There are two ways of interacting with TACEO's tooling:
  1. Standalone binaries that provide a command-line interface (CLI)
  2. Rust libraries that you can use in your projects

As mentioned earlier, TACEO provides [coCircom](/co-circom/co-circom.md) and [coNoir](/co-noir/co-noir.md) at the moment. The docs for each tool are split into two main sections, covering the CLI usage and a library description.
