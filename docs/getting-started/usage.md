# Usage

This section is empty at the moment ðŸ˜­

It will be updated in the course of the next weeks, so please be patient!

For the time being we recommend checking out the [Quick Start Guide](./quick-start.md) or the [examples folder on our GitHub](https://github.com/TaceoLabs/collaborative-circom/tree/main/co-circom/co-circom/examples), where we provide different `bash` scripts to prove some circom files.

Additionally, have a look at [the CLI commands](../co-circom/cli/cli.md) and the [additional material](../design/mpc-vm.md)!
