# TACEO:OPRF Overview

TACEO:OPRF is a service on the TACEO network for computing threshold Oblivious Pseudo-Random Functions (OPRFs) in a publicly auditable and provable way.

:::info Development Stage
TACEO:OPRF is currently in beta for development and testing. For production applications, [contact us](mailto:comms@taceo.io) to discuss deployment options.

## What Problem Does It Solve?

**The Challenge**: Traditional privacy systems have single points of failure. If your secret key leaks, attackers can trace your entire history.

**The Solution**: TACEO:OPRF distributes trust across multiple independent parties. Even if your secret leaks, attackers need to compromise multiple nodes to trace you.

## How TACEO:OPRF Works

TACEO:OPRF allows users to deterministically *salt* their secrets without ever revealing the secret itself. 

Unlike traditional single-server OPRF protocols, TACEO:OPRF is built on a multi-party computation (MPC) design. No single party can evaluate the OPRF on its own. Instead, a threshold of independent nodes must cooperate, providing the familiar trust guarantees of MPC-based systems.

### Key Features

- Privacy-preserving: Never reveals your secret inputs
- Threshold security: Requires cooperation of multiple independent nodes  
- ZK-friendly: Designed using zero-knowledge friendly primitives
- Flexible authorization: Customizable eligibility requirements

## Who Should Use It?

### Web3 Protocol Teams
Building identity systems (like World ID), DeFi protocols, or blockchain applications needing enhanced privacy guarantees.

### Privacy Infrastructure Companies  
Developing wallet recovery services, anonymous authentication systems, or privacy-preserving financial services.

### Enterprise Developers
Creating compliance systems, secure collaboration tools, or any application requiring distributed trust assumptions.

**Technical Requirements**: Comfort with cryptographic concepts, zero-knowledge proofs, and API integration. Ideal for teams already working with blockchain or privacy-focused technologies.

## Common Use Cases

### Nullifiers for Digital Identity
Problem: ZK identity systems rely on single secret keys. If leaked, your entire history is exposed.

Solution: TACEO:OPRF adds threshold security. Attackers need both your secret AND to break the MPC threshold to trace your identity.

*Used in: ZK Identity systems, anonymous voting, private credentials*

### Private Orderflow for DeFi  
Problem: DeFi protocols need referral tracking, but current methods surveille all transactions and destroy financial privacy.

Solution: Private referral identifiers via OPRF enable fee distribution without linking wallets to users or referrers.

*Used in: Decentralized exchanges, DeFi protocols, private trading platforms*

### Private Wallet Recovery
Problem: Seed phrases are a UX disaster. Custodial backup defeats the point of self-custody.

Solution: TACEO:OPRF enables wallet recovery where no one (not even the recovery service) ever sees your keys.

*Used in: Wallet applications, key management systems, secure backup solutions*

## How It Works

### 1. Authorization First
Users must prove they're eligible to evaluate the OPRF. This could be:
- Controlling an Ethereum private key
- Being a member of an authorized set  
- Providing a valid API key
- Custom authorization logic

### 2. Threshold Computation  
Multiple independent nodes cooperate to compute the OPRF without revealing:
- Your secret input
- The nodes' secret keys  
- The intermediate computation steps

### 3. Provable Results
The OPRF evaluation uses ZK-friendly primitives, so you can prove correct evaluation to third parties without revealing your private inputs.

## What You'll Learn

This documentation will help you:

- Understand the cryptographic foundations and architecture
- Integrate TACEO:OPRF into your applications  
- Deploy your own local test environment
- Implement custom authorization modules

### Developer API Access

We provide a developer API endpoint for experimentation against a live deployment. This consists of three MPC parties operated by TACEO and is intended for development and testing only.
