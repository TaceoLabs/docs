# OPRF Beta Notes

## Operational Notes for the beta OPRF service

When interacting with the hosted development setup, you may experience network latency depending on your location. All nodes are currently deployed in the EU (Frankfurt) region, so RTT will vary accordingly.

A single OPRF invocation takes on the order of 3 seconds including proofs and around 130ms without any proof generation or verification. The most computationally expensive step is the computation of the ZK proof. 

The hosted dev setup is operated entirely by TACEO. As a result, the MPC threshold assumption is not enforced in this environment.

There are no guarantees of liveness or stability, and the API may change without notice.
