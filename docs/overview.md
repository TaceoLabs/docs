# Overview

TACEO is building tooling for collaborative zkSNARKs (coSNARKs), and the MPC environments that are needed to produce them.

Here you will find documentation for tooling that lifts your code to work in MPC. So far, we have support for building collaborative SNARKs in

* Circom (see [coCircom](/co-circom/co-circom.md)), and
* Noir (see [coNoir](/co-noir/co-noir.md))

If you are completely new to working in an MPC environment, it may be worth checking out the [coCircom quick start](/getting-started/quick-start-co-circom.md) guide. It walks through compiling circuits, splitting the input, the witness extension, and proving and verifying the circuit.

If you wish to deploy your new coSNARK circuits, you'll need MPC nodes to run them on. You can either set this up yourself, or you can get in touch with us if you are interested to be an early tester of the coSNARK alphanet.

## Useful Resources

Throughout the docs you will find many links to useful articles and talks, but if you want to get started with some quick overviews, you can check out:

<!-- TACEO is creating the Compute Layer Security (CLS) protocol to make blockchain computation encrypted by default.
The CLS enables every application to compute on private shared state. At its core will be an MPC-VM capable of producing collaborative SNARKs. -->
