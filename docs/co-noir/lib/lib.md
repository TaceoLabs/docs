# coNoir Rust Library

The coNoir Rust library provides the same set of features as the [CLI](../cli/cli.md) variant of coNoir, where the [CLI](../cli/cli.md) essentially exposes the library functions to the user on the command line.

The library is meant to support you in developing your own application that makes use of coNoir's functionality. The next pages will guide you through setting up and including coNoir in your project.
