# Command-Line Interface

This section expands on using the coNoir CLI to perform witness extension and proof generation in MPC including preparation steps thereof. As mentioned earlier, coNoir is best used alongside [Noir](https://aztec.network/noir)'s package manager [nargo](https://docs.aztec.network/aztec/glossary#nargo) and Aztec's proof system [barretenberg](https://github.com/AztecProtocol/barretenberg) for generating intermediate artifacts.

The [interactive workshop at ZK12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2HJxrDE01k) demonstrates the usage and workflow of the coNoir CLI (at the end of the video, starting at [44:45](https://youtu.be/w2HJxrDE01k?si=HshhExrhce4KCgzG&t=2685)), as well as the coCircom CLI (at the beginning of the video).
