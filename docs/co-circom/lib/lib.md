# coCircom Rust Library

The coCircom Rust library provides the same set of features as the [CLI](../cli/cli.md) variant of coCircom, where the [CLI](../cli/cli.md) essentially exposes the library functions to the user on the command line.

The library is meant to support you in developing your own application that makes use of coCircom's functionality. The next pages will guide you through setting up and including coCircom in your project.
